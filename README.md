# MST
MST functionality for a graph
This Project was completed for ECE 250 - Data Structures and Algorithms. 
Idea of Project was to create a MST function to extract the number of nodes located within the graph. Utilized heaps, Prim's Algorithm,
and OOP to achieve a time complexity of O(ElogV) where E is number of edges , and V is number of nodes.
